# FloodIt
Game is created via JavaFX.

### Tutorial
* The top left rectangle is always your starting point (it means that you have already captured this territory);
* Each step you should decide which color to paint your territory (you can choose color via buttons: blue - b, red - r, ...);
* Number of steps is limited, so you can paint your territory only 25 times during game session;
* The goal of this game is to paint all territory with one color;

### Help
* Big rectangle contains 14*14=196 rectangles;
* Top rectangle on the right side of application window shows you number of completed steps;
* Bottom rectangle on the right side of applicaion window shows you your game session progress, each small rectangle of a big one is 4% of all territory;
* Small rectangles on the right side of game frame shows what button to press to paint your territory with a certain color;
